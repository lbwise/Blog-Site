		title: "Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba has not released blow-by-blow Singles' Day sales figures yet. Here's why that's a big deal.",
		content: `This year, all it's saying on its blog is that 382 brands have achieved sales of 100 million yuan ($15.6 million) 
			each si the event kicked off. That's not saying much at all, given that Apple sold $47 million of iPhones in the first 
			second of the sales event, as Alibaba said in its blog. Analysts say Alibaba is taking a low-key approach to stay out 
			of regulator scrutiny. The company's troubles started last year, when cofounder Jake Ma gave a speech criticizing China's 
			financial regulatory system. Ma's words angered the Chinese authorities, prompting intense regulatory scrutiny on his businesses.
			Alibaba's fintech spin-off Ant Group, for example, has had its mega IPO - most recently valued at $35 billion -suspended since 
			last November. And in December, Chinese regulators launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba that resulted in a 
			$2.8 billion fine. Ma - a high profile businessman fond of flamboyant performances - also disappeared from public view for 
			two months late last year before reappearing in a video conference in late January. He was sighted in Spain recently, Reuters 
			reported, citing local media. 'This year's muted festivities are a perfect storm of economic, competitive and regulatory pressures,
			said Michael Norris, research strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, per the Associated Press. In terms 
			of regulation, e-commerce platforms are coming to grips with how to align consumption extravaganzas with 'common prosperity' themes," 
			he added to the AP. 'China's Double 11 loses glamour, focuses on high-quality growth amid tight regulations," Chinese Communist 
			Party's Global Times newspaper surmised. Alibaba did not immediately to Insider's request for comment on whether it will be 
			releasing sales figures this year, but a spokesperson told the AFP numbers would only be announced after the event's window closes 
			late on Thursday. Competitor JD.com, on the other hand, has already reported record sales of 311.4 billion Chinese yuan 
			($48.6 billion), and the event is still ongoing. This surpasses the 271.5 billion Chinese yuan ($42.4 million) JD.com made in sales in the 11-day event last year.`

		title: "Report: 57% of all ecommerce cyberattacks are bot-driven",
		content: `According to a 12-month analysis by Imperva Research Labs of cybersecurity risks impacting ecommerce, 
		57% of all attacks recorded on ecommerce websites were carried out by bots in 2021, compared to 33% for all other industries. 
		The report reveals that the ecommerce industry remains a prime target for cybercrime. As global supply chain challenges continue 
		into the 2021 holiday shopping season, retailers could see further disruptions caused by cyberattacks. Automated bot activity is
		a pervasive threat for ecommerce. In 2021, the volume of monthly bot attacks on retail sites increased 13% compared to 2020. 
		Particularly noteworthy: The proportion of sophisticated bad bots on retail websites also grew in 2021. This breed of bot is the 
		hardest to stop because they produce mouse movements and clicks that resemble human behavior. Sophisticated bots evade simple 
		defenses and are responsible for account takeover, fraud, and denial of inventory that makes it harder for legitimate shoppers 
		to get the goods they want.`
